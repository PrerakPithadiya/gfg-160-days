# GfG 160: Mastering DSA in 160 Days with Java

Welcome to my **GfG 160** repository! This repository documents my daily progress through the **GeeksforGeeks 160-Day DSA Roadmap**, where I solve **handpicked Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems in **Java**. The goal is to master key DSA concepts and prepare for coding interviews.

This repository will contain **daily solutions to DSA problems** only, with no project submissions included. All solutions will be provided in **Java** and will focus on topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and more.

## About the Course
The **GfG 160** course is a structured 160-day learning journey that provides a comprehensive roadmap for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms**. The course focuses on daily problem-solving with an emphasis on learning and practicing DSA in a step-by-step manner, ideal for anyone looking to improve their coding skills or prepare for coding interviews.

### Key Features:
- **160 Handpicked DSA Problems**: A curated list of problems, each with a detailed explanation.
- **90 Bonus Problems**: Additional problems to further solidify my understanding, totaling 250 problems.
- **Completion Certificate**: A certificate earned after completing the course, showcasing my knowledge of DSA.
- **Career Roadmap Sessions**: Free workshops on trending technologies, though not part of this repository.
  
## Course Structure
The course is structured to help me progress through the key DSA topics, with a clear path and daily problems to solve. Hereâ€™s an overview of the flow:

1. **Arrays and Strings**
2. **Sorting and Searching**
3. **Matrix and Hashing**
4. **Two Pointer Technique**
5. **Prefix Sum and Sliding Window**
6. **Recursion and Backtracking**
7. **Dynamic Programming**
8. **Greedy Algorithms**
9. **Graph Theory**
10. **Advanced Data Structures**

Each day, I will solve one problem related to the topic at hand, building my expertise progressively.

## Topics Covered
The **GfG 160** course covers a wide range of essential DSA topics. These topics will be explored in depth throughout the 160 days, with the solutions uploaded daily in **Java**. Topics include:

- **Arrays**: Sorting, Searching, Sliding Window
- **Strings**: Pattern Matching, Anagram Detection
- **Hashing**: Hash Maps, Sets
- **Recursion and Backtracking**: Subset Generation, Permutations
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Shortest Path
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity Selection, Job Scheduling

## Assured Rewards
By maintaining consistency in solving problems daily, I will be eligible for rewards, such as a **GeeksforGeeks Bag**. I will ensure to maintain my solving streak to earn these rewards and stay motivated.

## Career Roadmap Sessions
Although this repository is focused on solving DSA problems, the **GfG 160** course also offers extra career roadmap sessions on topics like DevOps, Full Stack Development, and Software Testing. However, these workshops will not be included in this repository.

## How to Contribute
Since this repository is dedicated solely to daily DSA solutions, contributions related to problem solutions or enhancements are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, solve the problems in Java, and create pull requests with your solutions. Collaboration and learning together are highly encouraged.
